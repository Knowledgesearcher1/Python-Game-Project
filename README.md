1. Features
   -  For the first stage of development, I will create a ship capable of moving both right and left. The ship should also be able to fire bullets when the player presses the spacebar. After establishing this functionality, we can shift our focus to the enemy ships, enhance the gameplay, set up the menus, and add music, among other improvements.
   -  Next I will add a ship to the game and create a ship class to manage all the features of the ship.
